# How to View Build Project Path in Jenkins

Welcome to the guide on how to view the build project path in Jenkins! This step-by-step tutorial will walk you through the process of locating the project path for a specific build in Jenkins.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:

- Access to a Jenkins server
- Basic knowledge of Jenkins terminology and navigation

## üìú Steps to View Build Project Path

1. Launch Jenkins: Open your web browser and navigate to the URL of your Jenkins server.

2. Locate the build: Find the specific build for which you want to view the project path. This could be a job or a pipeline.

3. Open the build details: Click on the build number or ID associated with the desired build. This will take you to the build details page.

4. View the project path: Look for the "Workspace" or "Project Workspace" section on the build details page. This section displays the path to the project's workspace or checkout directory.

5. Note the project path: Take note of the path mentioned in the "Workspace" or "Project Workspace" section. This path represents the location where the build project's files and source code are stored.

6. Access the project path: Depending on your Jenkins setup, you may need to connect to the Jenkins server or a connected agent/slave machine to access the project path. Use the appropriate method to access the project path, such as SSH or a file explorer.

## üíª Command Line Approach

If you prefer using the command line, you can also retrieve the project path by executing the following command:

jenkins_home=$(curl -s 'http://localhost:8080/jenkins/script' --data-urlencode 'script=println(Jenkins.instance.rootPath)' --user <username>:<password>)
echo ${jenkins_home}

Replace <username> and <password> with your Jenkins credentials. This command uses the Jenkins Script Console API to retrieve the Jenkins home directory path.

üìù Conclusion

By following the steps provided in this guide, you should now be able to view the build project path for a specific build in Jenkins. Whether you prefer navigating through the Jenkins interface or using the command line approach, you have multiple options to obtain the necessary information.

Remember to note down the project path for further reference or troubleshooting purposes. Happy building!
